## Setup

I'm using Visual Studio Code for creating my journals.

### SimCenter dll's for intellisense

Because of copyright concerns I did not add the dll's required for intellisense to this repository. Also, you want to use the dll's from the specific SimCenter version that you are using.

In order to have intellisense do either of the following:
 1. Copy the following SimCenter dll's into the dlls folder:
   * NXOpen.dll
   * NXOpen.Utilities.dll
   * NXOpen.UF.dll
   * NXOpenUI.dll
 2. Update the references in NXOpenCAE.csproj to point to the dll's for the specific version that you are using.

 ### VSCode +.NET framework

 This repository and the course on Udemy focus on journals only, meaning none of the code is compiled.
 Every file can run as a journal, without additional licenses (provided you have the licenses to perform the same operations in the GUI)
 Since I'm writing the journals on a linux machine, I'm referencing the netcoreapp3.1 as the targetframework, so I get a working intellisense.
